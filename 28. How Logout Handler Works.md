# Spring Security Custom Logout Handler

The Spring Security framework provides very flexible and powerful support for [authentication](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-security-authentication-and-registration). Together with user identification, we'll typically want to handle user logout events and, in some cases, add some custom logout behavior. One such use case could be for invalidating a user cache or closing authenticated sessions.

For this very purpose, Spring provides the *LogoutHandler* interface, and in this tutorial, we'll take a look at how to implement our own custom logout handler.

### *LogoutHandler* Interface

```
public interface LogoutHandler {
    void logout(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response,Authentication authentication);
}
```

It is possible to add as many logout handlers as we need to our application. **The one requirement for the implementation is that no exceptions are thrown**. This is because handler actions must not break the application state on logout.

For example, one of the handlers may do some cache cleanup, and its method must complete successfully. In the tutorial example, we'll show exactly this use case.

### *LogoutSuccessHandler* Interface

On the other hand, we can use exceptions to control the user logout strategy. For this, we have the [*LogoutSuccessHandler*](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-security-track-logged-in-users#2-implementing-logoutsuccesshandler) interface and the *onLogoutSuccess* method. This method may raise an exception to set user redirection to an appropriate destination.

Furthermore, **it's not possible to add multiple handlers when using a \*LogoutSuccessHandler\* type**, so there is only one possible implementation for the application. Generally speaking, it turns out that it's the last point of the logout strategy.

## *LogoutHandler* Interface in Practice

Now, let's create a simple web application to demonstrate the logout handling process. We'll implement some simple caching logic to retrieve user data to avoid unnecessary hits on the database.

Let's start with the *application.properties* file, which contains the database connection properties for our sample application:

```
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/test
spring.datasource.username=test
spring.datasource.password=test
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create
```

###  Web Application Setup

Next, we'll add a simple *User* entity that we'll use for login purposes and data retrieval. As we can see, the *User* class maps to the *users* table in our database:

```
@Entity
@Table(name = "users")
public class User {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Integer id;

    @Column(unique = true)
    private String login;

    private String password;

    private String role;

    private String language;

    // standard setters and getters
}
```

For the caching purposes of our application, we'll implement a cache service that uses a *ConcurrentHashMap* internally to store users:

```
@Service
public class UserCache {
    @PersistenceContext
    private EntityManager entityManager;

    private final ConcurrentMap<String, User> store = new ConcurrentHashMap<>(256);
}
```

Using this service, we can retrieve a user by user name (login) from the database and store it internally in our map:

```
public User getByUserName(String userName) {
    return store.computeIfAbsent(userName, k -> 
      entityManager.createQuery("from User where login=:login", User.class)
        .setParameter("login", k)
        .getSingleResult());
}
```

Furthermore, it is possible to evict the user from the store. As we'll see later, this will be the main action that we'll invoke from our logout handler:

```
public void evictUser(String userName) {
    store.remove(userName);
}
```

To retrieve user data and language information we'll use a standard [Spring *Controller*](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-controllers):

```
@Controller
@RequestMapping(path = "/user")
public class UserController {

    private final UserCache userCache;

    public UserController(UserCache userCache) {
        this.userCache = userCache;
    }

    @GetMapping(path = "/language")
    @ResponseBody
    public String getLanguage() {
        String userName = UserUtils.getAuthenticatedUserName();
        User user = userCache.getByUserName(userName);
        return user.getLanguage();
    }
}
```

### Web Security Configuration

There are two simple actions we’ll focus on in the application — login and logout. First, we need to set up our MVC configuration class to allow users to authenticate using [Basic HTTP Auth](https://www.baeldung.com/httpclient-4-basic-authentication):

```
@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
public class MvcConfiguration extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    @Autowired
    private CustomLogoutHandler logoutHandler;

    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http.httpBasic()
            .and()
                .authorizeRequests()
                    .antMatchers(HttpMethod.GET, "/user/**")
                    .hasRole("USER")
            .and()
                .logout()
                    .logoutUrl("/user/logout")
                    .addLogoutHandler(logoutHandler)
                    .logoutSuccessHandler(new HttpStatusReturningLogoutSuccessHandler(HttpStatus.OK))
                    .permitAll()
            .and()
                .csrf()
                    .disable()
                .formLogin()
                    .disable();
    }

    // further configuration
}
```

The important part to note from the above configuration is the *addLogoutHandler* method. We pass and **trigger our \*CustomLogoutHandler\* at the end of logout processing**. The remaining settings fine-tune the HTTP Basic Auth.

### Custom Logout Handler

Finally, and most importantly, we'll write our custom logout handler that handles the necessary user cache cleanup:

```
@Service
public class CustomLogoutHandler implements LogoutHandler {

    private final UserCache userCache;

    public CustomLogoutHandler(UserCache userCache) {
        this.userCache = userCache;
    }

    @Override
    public void logout(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, 
      Authentication authentication) {
        String userName = UserUtils.getAuthenticatedUserName();
        userCache.evictUser(userName);
    }
}
```
