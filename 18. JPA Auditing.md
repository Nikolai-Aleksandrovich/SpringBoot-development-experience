### Auditing

#### Basics

* Spring Data可以跟踪创建和修改实体类的时间和账号
* 只追踪创建和修改日期的，则不需要创建AuditorAware
*  `@CreatedBy` and `@LastModifiedBy` 捕捉谁，`@CreatedDate` and `@LastModifiedDate` 捕捉日期
* 可以直接对实体类使用注释，也可以让实体类实现自定义的抽象类，或者直接实现一个自动生成的AbstractAuditable，但这样会增加程序之间的耦合
* 要了解用户，就要实现一个AuditorAware<T>接口，获取当前用户信息，在其中覆写getCurrentAuditor获取当前用户信息
* 其次，必须在xml文件配置，确保路径有jar包，才可以启动配置@EnableJpaAuditing

# 总结：如何使用Spring Data JPA的Auditor Aware：

* 首先创建基础类，注意要加上@Entity，加上@EntityListener（AEL），加入@Getter@Setter，再加入要加的@CreatedBY之类的。
* 其次另需要具有这些功能的类继承基类
* 然后写配置类：
  * 注意要加上@EnableJpaAuditing
  * 首先在配置类中加入静态内置类，实现AuditorAware<T>接口，t就是要返回的类型，在类中覆写getCurrentAuditor，得到当前登录信息，又因为所有的用户类都实现了UserDetails接口，所以其实可以用一个UserDetails接口作为返回类

Spring Data provides sophisticated support to transparently keep track of who created or changed an entity and when the change happened. To benefit from that functionality

##### Annotation-based Auditing Metadata

We provide `@CreatedBy` and `@LastModifiedBy` to capture the user who created or modified the entity as well as `@CreatedDate` and `@LastModifiedDate` to capture when the change happened.

**An audited entity**

```
class Customer {

  @CreatedBy
  private User user;

  @CreatedDate
  private Instant createdDate;

  // … further properties omitted
}
```

The annotations capturing when changes were made can be used on properties of type Joda-Time, `DateTime`, legacy Java `Date` and `Calendar`, JDK8 date and time types, and `long` or `Long`.

Auditing metadata does not necessarily need to live in the root level entity but can be added to an embedded one (depending on the actual store in use), as shown in the snipped below.

 **Audit metadata in embedded entity**

```
class Customer {

  private AuditMetadata auditingMetadata;

  // … further properties omitted
}

class AuditMetadata {

  @CreatedBy
  private User user;

  @CreatedDate
  private Instant createdDate;

}
```

##### Interface-based Auditing Metadata

In case you do not want to use annotations to define auditing metadata, you can let your domain class implement the `Auditable` interface. It exposes setter methods for all of the auditing properties.

There is also a convenience base class, `AbstractAuditable`, which you can extend to avoid the need to manually implement the interface methods. Doing so increases the coupling of your domain classes to Spring Data, which might be something you want to avoid. Usually, the annotation-based way of defining auditing metadata is preferred as it is less invasive and more flexible.

##### `AuditorAware`

In case you use either `@CreatedBy` or `@LastModifiedBy`, the auditing infrastructure somehow needs to become aware of the current principal. To do so, we provide an `AuditorAware<T>` SPI interface that you have to implement to tell the infrastructure who the current user or system interacting with the application is. The generic type `T` defines what type the properties annotated with `@CreatedBy` or `@LastModifiedBy` have to be.

The following example shows an implementation of the interface that uses Spring Security’s `Authentication` object:

 **Implementation of** `AuditorAware` **based on Spring Security**

```
class SpringSecurityAuditorAware implements AuditorAware<User> {

  @Override
  public Optional<User> getCurrentAuditor() {

    return Optional.ofNullable(SecurityContextHolder.getContext())
            .map(SecurityContext::getAuthentication)
            .filter(Authentication::isAuthenticated)
            .map(Authentication::getPrincipal)
            .map(User.class::cast);
  }
}
```

The implementation accesses the `Authentication` object provided by Spring Security and looks up the custom `UserDetails` instance that you have created in your `UserDetailsService` implementation. We assume here that you are exposing the domain user through the `UserDetails` implementation but that, based on the `Authentication` found, you could also look it up from anywhere.

##### `ReactiveAuditorAware`

When using reactive infrastructure you might want to make use of contextual information to provide `@CreatedBy` or `@LastModifiedBy` information. We provide an `ReactiveAuditorAware<T>` SPI interface that you have to implement to tell the infrastructure who the current user or system interacting with the application is. The generic type `T` defines what type the properties annotated with `@CreatedBy` or `@LastModifiedBy` have to be.

The following example shows an implementation of the interface that uses reactive Spring Security’s `Authentication` object:

**Implementation of** `ReactiveAuditorAware` **based on Spring Security**

```
class SpringSecurityAuditorAware implements ReactiveAuditorAware<User> {

  @Override
  public Mono<User> getCurrentAuditor() {

    return ReactiveSecurityContextHolder.getContext()
                .map(SecurityContext::getAuthentication)
                .filter(Authentication::isAuthenticated)
                .map(Authentication::getPrincipal)
                .map(User.class::cast);
  }
}
```

The implementation accesses the `Authentication` object provided by Spring Security and looks up the custom `UserDetails` instance that you have created in your `UserDetailsService` implementation. We assume here that you are exposing the domain user through the `UserDetails` implementation but that, based on the `Authentication` found, you could also look it up from anywhere. 

####  JPA Auditing

##### General Auditing Configuration

Spring Data JPA ships with an entity listener that can be used to trigger the capturing of auditing information. First, You can also enable the `AuditingEntityListener` on a per-entity basis by using the `@EntityListeners` annotation, as follows:

```
@Entity
@EntityListeners(AuditingEntityListener.class)
public class MyEntity {

}
```

The auditing feature requires `spring-aspects.jar` to be on the classpath.

With `orm.xml` suitably modified and `spring-aspects.jar` on the classpath, activating auditing functionality is a matter of adding the Spring Data JPA `auditing` namespace element to your configuration, as follows:

**Activating auditing using XML configuration**

```
<jpa:auditing auditor-aware-ref="yourAuditorAwareBean" />
```

As of Spring Data JPA 1.5, you can enable auditing by annotating a configuration class with the `@EnableJpaAuditing` annotation. You must still modify the `orm.xml` file and have `spring-aspects.jar` on the classpath. The following example shows how to use the `@EnableJpaAuditing` annotation:

```
@Configuration
@EnableJpaAuditing
class Config {

  @Bean
  public AuditorAware<AuditableUser> auditorProvider() {
    return new AuditorAwareImpl();
  }
}
```

If you expose a bean of type `AuditorAware` to the `ApplicationContext`, the auditing infrastructure automatically picks it up and uses it to determine the current user to be set on domain types. If you have multiple implementations registered in the `ApplicationContext`, you can select the one to be used by explicitly setting the `auditorAwareRef` attribute of `@EnableJpaAuditing`.

### Miscellaneous Considerations

#### Using `JpaContext` in Custom Implementations

When working with multiple `EntityManager` instances and [custom repository implementations](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/docs/current/reference/html/index.html#repositories.custom-implementations), you need to wire the correct `EntityManager` into the repository implementation class. You can do so by explicitly naming the `EntityManager` in the `@PersistenceContext` annotation or, if the `EntityManager` is `@Autowired`, by using `@Qualifier`.

**Using** `JpaContext` **in a custom repository implementation**

```
class UserRepositoryImpl implements UserRepositoryCustom {

  private final EntityManager em;

  @Autowired
  public UserRepositoryImpl(JpaContext context) {
    this.em = context.getEntityManagerByManagedType(User.class);
  }

  …
}
```

The advantage of this approach is that, if the domain type gets assigned to a different persistence unit, the repository does not have to be touched to alter the reference to the persistence unit.

####  Merging persistence units

Spring supports having multiple persistence units. Sometimes, however, you might want to modularize your application but still make sure that all these modules run inside a single persistence unit. To enable that behavior, Spring Data JPA offers a `PersistenceUnitManager` implementation that automatically merges persistence units based on their name, as shown in the following example:

**Using MergingPersistenceUnitmanager**

```
<bean class="….LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean">
  <property name="persistenceUnitManager">
    <bean class="….MergingPersistenceUnitManager" />
  </property>
</bean>
```

##### Classpath Scanning for @Entity Classes and JPA Mapping Files

A plain JPA setup requires all annotation-mapped entity classes to be listed in `orm.xml`. The same applies to XML mapping files. Spring Data JPA provides a `ClasspathScanningPersistenceUnitPostProcessor` that gets a base package configured and optionally takes a mapping filename pattern. It then scans the given package for classes annotated with `@Entity` or `@MappedSuperclass`, loads the configuration files that match the filename pattern, and hands them to the JPA configuration. The post-processor must be configured as follows:

 **Using ClasspathScanningPersistenceUnitPostProcessor**

```
<bean class="….LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean">
  <property name="persistenceUnitPostProcessors">
    <list>
      <bean class="org.springframework.data.jpa.support.ClasspathScanningPersistenceUnitPostProcessor">
        <constructor-arg value="com.acme.domain" />
        <property name="mappingFileNamePattern" value="**/*Mapping.xml" />
      </bean>
    </list>
  </property>
</bean>
```
