## Reactive Repositories

The repositories programming model is the most high-level abstraction Spring Data users usually deal with. They’re usually comprised of a set of CRUD methods defined in a Spring Data provided interface and domain-specific query methods. Here’s what a reactive Spring Data repository definition would look like

```
public interface ReactivePersonRepository
  extends ReactiveCrudRepository<Person, String> {

  Flux<Person> findByLastname(Mono<String> lastname);

  @Query("{ 'firstname': ?0, 'lastname': ?1}")
  Mono<Person> findByFirstnameAndLastname(String firstname, String lastname);
}
```

As you can see, there’s not too much difference to what you’re used to. However, in contrast to the traditional repository interfaces, a reactive repository uses reactive types as return types and can do so for parameter types, too. The CRUD methods in the newly introduced `ReactiveCrudRepository`, of course make use of these types, too.

By default, reactive repositories use [Project Reactor](https://projectreactor.io/) types but other reactive libraries can also be used. We provide a custom repository base interface (e.g. `RxJava2CrudRepository`) for those and also automatically adapt the types as needed for query methods, e.g RxJava’s `Observable` and `Single`. The rest basically stays the same. Note, however, that the current milestone does not support pagination yet and you of course have to have the necessary reactive libraries on the classpath to activate support for a particular library.

### Activating reactive Spring Data

Similarly to what we have in the blocking world, the support for reactive Spring Data is activated through an `@Enable…` annotation alongside some infrastructure setup:

```
@EnableReactiveMongoRepositories
public class AppConfig extends AbstractReactiveMongoConfiguration {

  @Bean
  public MongoClient mongoClient() {
    return MongoClients.create();
  }

  @Override
  protected String getDatabaseName() {
    return "reactive";
  }
}
```

## Using reactive repositories

```
@RestController
class PersonController {

  private final PersonRepository people;

  public PersonController(PersonRepository people) {
    this.people = people;
  }

  @GetMapping("/people")
  Flux<String> namesByLastname(@RequestParam Mono<String> lastname) {

    Flux<Person> result = repository.findByLastname(lastname);
    return result.map(it -> it.getFullName());
  }
}
```
