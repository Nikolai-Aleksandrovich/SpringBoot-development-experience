2. Some important baselines are missing. 

   This article only compares the basic method with the baselines designed by themselves.  There are lots of related work on trajectory clustering of moving object.

where 

[1] proposed micro-group based clustering algorithm over evolving data stream to reduce computational time complexity;

[2] proposed a framework based on Apache Flink, which is designed to clustering and pattern enumeration for efficient distributed streaming data processing. 

[3] presents a spatio-temporal trajectory clustering method for vehicle trajectories in transportation networks to identify heterogeneous trip patterns and explore underlying network assignment mechanisms. 

[4] proposed a fusion of the MD, MDS, and improved DBSCAN algorithms can identify the course of trajectories and attain a better clustering performance.

[5] proposed a trajectory clustering approach that considers additional semantics and extend the proposed clustering to take into account the sequence of trajectory.
