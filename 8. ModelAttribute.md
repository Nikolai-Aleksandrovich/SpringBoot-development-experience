# Spring MVC and the @ModelAttribute Annotation

* 绑定一个方法参数或者方法返回值，并把它传递给视图

* 在SpringMVC中，@ModelAttribute的方法先唤起，再唤起RequestMapping下的方法

* 在@ModelAttribute中的值可以被看作默认且global的

  作为方法参数：

  * 从Model中检索名字符合的值，并把值赋给参数
  * 如果没有，那就先初始化一个值
  * 意味着把数据绑定到了一个bean中，避免了把数据从不同的域中相互传递

The *@ModelAttribute* is an annotation that binds a method parameter or method return value to a named model attribute and then exposes it to a web view.

## **The @ModelAttribute in Depth**

### **At the Method Level**

When the annotation is used at the method level it indicates the purpose of that method is to add one or more model attributes. Such methods support the same argument types as [@RequestMapping](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/bind/annotation/RequestMapping.html) methods but that cannot be mapped directly to requests.

```
@ModelAttribute
public void addAttributes(Model model) {
    model.addAttribute("msg", "Welcome to the Netherlands!");
}
```

In general, Spring-MVC will always make a call first to that method, before it calls any request handler methods. **That is, \*@ModelAttribute\* methods are invoked before the controller methods annotated with \*@RequestMapping\* are invoked.** The logic behind the sequence is that, the model object has to be created before any processing starts inside the controller methods.

It is also important that you annotate the respective class as [@ControllerAdvice](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/bind/annotation/ControllerAdvice.html). Thus, you can add values in *Model* which will be identified as global. This actually means that for every request a default value exists, for every method in the response part.

### **As a Method Argument**

When used as a method argument, it indicates the argument should be retrieved from the model. When not present, it should be first instantiated and then added to the model and once present in the model, the arguments fields should be populated from all request parameters that have matching names.

```
@RequestMapping(value = "/addEmployee", method = RequestMethod.POST)
public String submit(@ModelAttribute("employee") Employee employee) {
    // Code that uses the employee object

    return "employeeView";
}
```

So, it binds the form data with a bean. **The controller annotated with \*@RequestMapping\* can have custom class argument(s) annotated with \*@ModelAttribute\*.**

## Example

### view：

```html
<form:form method="POST" action="/spring-mvc-basics/addEmployee" 
  modelAttribute="employee">
    <form:label path="name">Name</form:label>
    <form:input path="name" />
    
    <form:label path="id">Id</form:label>
    <form:input path="id" />
    
    <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
</form:form>
```

### Controller：

Furthermore, there is also an *addAttributes()* method. Its purpose is to add values in the *Model* which will be identified globally. That is, a default value will be returned as a response for every request to every controller method. We also have to annotate the specific class as *@ControllerAdvice*.

```
@Controller
@ControllerAdvice
public class EmployeeController {

    private Map<Long, Employee> employeeMap = new HashMap<>();

    @RequestMapping(value = "/addEmployee", method = RequestMethod.POST)
    public String submit(
      @ModelAttribute("employee") Employee employee,
      BindingResult result, ModelMap model) {
        if (result.hasErrors()) {
            return "error";
        }
        model.addAttribute("name", employee.getName());
        model.addAttribute("id", employee.getId());

        employeeMap.put(employee.getId(), employee);

        return "employeeView";
    }

    @ModelAttribute
    public void addAttributes(Model model) {
        model.addAttribute("msg", "Welcome to the Netherlands!");
    }
}
```

### **The Model**

```
@Data
@Entity
public class Employee{
	@Id
	@GeneratedValue
	private Long id;
	private final String name;
}
```

The *@ControllerAdvice* assists a controller and in particular, *@ModelAttribute* methods that apply to all *@RequestMapping* methods. Of course, our *addAttributes()* method will be the very first to run, prior to the rest of the *@RequestMapping* methods.

Keeping that in mind and after both of *submit()* and *addAttributes()* are run, we could just refer to them in the *View* returned from the *Controller* class, by mentioning their given name inside a dollarized curly-braces duo, like for example *${name}*.
