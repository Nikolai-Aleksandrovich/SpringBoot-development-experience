Spring DATA JPA：

* CrudRepository的接口有一些默认方法，不需要配置就可使用，这个接口继承自Repository
*  [`PagingAndSortingRepository`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/commons/docs/current/api/org/springframework/data/repository/PagingAndSortingRepository.html) 拓展了CrudRepository接口，用于排序和分页，findAll接受Pageable,Sort
* 使用拓展CrudRepository接口，进行CRUD操作，分为四步，首先拓展接口，其次定义方法接口，其次进行配置，最后注入并调用
* 如果不想使用Spring Data JPA， 使用@RepositoryDefinition标注自己的接口也可以
* 如果想用自定义某些方法，可以在实体类的repository中定义，这样优先级更高
* Spring Data JPA 在有多个JPA模型的情况下，严格匹配拓展类和注解，以此为实体生成方法。
* 数据库CRUD方法：要么从名字推断，要么使用自己创造的
* 





### Core concepts

The central interface in the Spring Data repository abstraction is `Repository`. It takes the domain class to manage as well as the ID type of the domain class as type arguments. This interface acts primarily as a marker interface to capture the types to work with and to help you to discover interfaces that extend this one. The [`CrudRepository`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/commons/docs/current/api/org/springframework/data/repository/CrudRepository.html) interface provides sophisticated CRUD functionality for the entity class that is being managed.

`CrudRepository` **Interface**

```
public interface CrudRepository<T, ID> extends Repository<T, ID> {

  <S extends T> S save(S entity);      

  Optional<T> findById(ID primaryKey); 

  Iterable<T> findAll();               

  long count();                        

  void delete(T entity);               

  boolean existsById(ID primaryKey);   

  // … more functionality omitted.
}
```

On top of the `CrudRepository`, there is a [`PagingAndSortingRepository`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/commons/docs/current/api/org/springframework/data/repository/PagingAndSortingRepository.html) abstraction that adds additional methods to ease paginated access to entities:

`PagingAndSortingRepository` **interface**

```
public interface PagingAndSortingRepository<T, ID> extends CrudRepository<T, ID> {

  Iterable<T> findAll(Sort sort);

  Page<T> findAll(Pageable pageable);
}
```

To access the second page of `User` by a page size of 20, you could do something like the following:

```
PagingAndSortingRepository<User, Long> repository = // … get access to a bean
Page<User> users = repository.findAll(PageRequest.of(1, 20));
```

In addition to query methods, query derivation for both count and delete queries is available. The following list shows the interface definition for a derived count query:

**Derived Count Query**

```
interface UserRepository extends CrudRepository<User, Long> {

  long countByLastname(String lastname);
}
```

**Derived Delete Query**

```
interface UserRepository extends CrudRepository<User, Long> {

  long deleteByLastname(String lastname);

  List<User> removeByLastname(String lastname);
}
```

### Query Methods

Standard CRUD functionality repositories usually have queries on the underlying datastore. With Spring Data, declaring those queries becomes a four-step process:

1. Declare an interface extending Repository or one of its subinterfaces and type it to the domain class and ID type that it should handle, as shown in the following example:

```
interface PersonRepository extends Repository<Person, Long> { … }
```

2. Declare query methods on the interface.

```
interface PersonRepository extends Repository<Person, Long> {
  List<Person> findByLastname(String lastname);
}
```

3. Set up Spring to create proxy instances for those interfaces, either with [JavaConfig](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/docs/current/reference/html/index.html#repositories.create-instances.java-config) or with [XML configuration](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/docs/current/reference/html/index.html#repositories.create-instances).
   To use Java configuration, create a class similar to the following:

   ```
   import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.config.EnableJpaRepositories;
   
   @EnableJpaRepositories
   class Config { … }
   ```

   

4. Inject the repository instance and use it, as shown in the following example:

```
class SomeClient {

  private final PersonRepository repository;

  SomeClient(PersonRepository repository) {
    this.repository = repository;
  }

  void doSomething() {
    List<Person> persons = repository.findByLastname("Matthews");
  }
}
```

### Defining Repository Interfaces

To define a repository interface, you first need to define a domain class-specific repository interface. The interface must extend `Repository` and be typed to the domain class and an ID type. If you want to expose CRUD methods for that domain type, extend `CrudRepository` instead of `Repository`.

####  Fine-tuning Repository Definition

Typically, your repository interface extends `Repository`, `CrudRepository`, or `PagingAndSortingRepository`. Alternatively, if you do not want to extend Spring Data interfaces, you can also annotate your repository interface with `@RepositoryDefinition`. Extending `CrudRepository` exposes a complete set of methods to manipulate your entities. If you prefer to be selective about the methods being exposed, copy the methods you want to expose from `CrudRepository` into your domain repository.

 Doing so lets you define your own abstractions on top of the provided Spring Data Repositories functionality.

The following example shows how to selectively expose CRUD methods (`findById` and `save`, in this case):

Selectively exposing CRUD methods

```
@NoRepositoryBean
//Spring Data should not create instances at runtime.
interface MyBaseRepository<T, ID> extends Repository<T, ID> {

  Optional<T> findById(ID id);

  <S extends T> S save(S entity);
}

interface UserRepository extends MyBaseRepository<User, Long> {
  User findByEmailAddress(EmailAddress emailAddress);
}
```

In the prior example, you defined a common base interface for all your domain repositories and exposed `findById(…)` as well as `save(…)`.These methods are routed into the base repository implementation of the store of your choice provided by Spring Data (for example, if you use JPA, the implementation is `SimpleJpaRepository`), because they match the method signatures in `CrudRepository`. So the `UserRepository` can now save users, find individual users by ID, and trigger a query to find `Users` by email address.

#### Using Repositories with Multiple Spring Data Modules

Using a unique Spring Data module in your application makes things simple, because all repository interfaces in the defined scope are bound to the Spring Data module. Sometimes, applications require using more than one Spring Data module. In such cases, a repository definition must distinguish between persistence technologies. When it detects multiple repository factories on the class path, Spring Data enters strict repository configuration mode. Strict configuration uses details on the repository or the domain class to decide about Spring Data module binding for a repository definition:

1. If the repository definition [extends the module-specific repository](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/docs/current/reference/html/index.html#repositories.multiple-modules.types), it is a valid candidate for the particular Spring Data module.
2. If the domain class is [annotated with the module-specific type annotation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/docs/current/reference/html/index.html#repositories.multiple-modules.annotations), it is a valid candidate for the particular Spring Data module. Spring Data modules accept either third-party annotations (such as JPA’s `@Entity`) or provide their own annotations (such as `@Document` for Spring Data MongoDB and Spring Data Elasticsearch).

The following example shows a repository that uses module-specific interfaces (JPA in this case):

```
interface MyRepository extends JpaRepository<User, Long> { }

@NoRepositoryBean
interface MyBaseRepository<T, ID> extends JpaRepository<T, ID> { … }

interface UserRepository extends MyBaseRepository<User, Long> { … }
```

`MyRepository` and `UserRepository` extend `JpaRepository` in their type hierarchy. They are valid candidates for the Spring Data JPA module.

**Repository definitions using generic interfaces**

```
interface AmbiguousRepository extends Repository<User, Long> { … }

@NoRepositoryBean
interface MyBaseRepository<T, ID> extends CrudRepository<T, ID> { … }

interface AmbiguousUserRepository extends MyBaseRepository<User, Long> { … }
```

`AmbiguousRepository` and `AmbiguousUserRepository` extend only `Repository` and `CrudRepository` in their type hierarchy. While this is fine when using a unique Spring Data module, multiple modules cannot distinguish to which particular Spring Data these repositories should be bound.

**Repository definitions using domain classes with annotations**

```
interface PersonRepository extends Repository<Person, Long> { … }

@Entity
class Person { … }

interface UserRepository extends Repository<User, Long> { … }

@Document
class User { … }
```

`PersonRepository` references `Person`, which is annotated with the JPA `@Entity` annotation, so this repository clearly belongs to Spring Data JPA. `UserRepository` references `User`, which is annotated with Spring Data MongoDB’s `@Document` annotation.

**Repository definitions using domain classes with mixed annotations**

```
interface JpaPersonRepository extends Repository<Person, Long> { … }

interface MongoDBPersonRepository extends Repository<Person, Long> { … }

@Entity
@Document
class Person { … }
```

This example shows a domain class using both JPA and Spring Data MongoDB annotations. It defines two repositories, `JpaPersonRepository` and `MongoDBPersonRepository`. One is intended for JPA and the other for MongoDB usage. Spring Data is no longer able to tell the repositories apart, which leads to undefined behavior.

[Repository type details](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/docs/current/reference/html/index.html#repositories.multiple-modules.types) and [distinguishing domain class annotations](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/docs/current/reference/html/index.html#repositories.multiple-modules.annotations) are used for strict repository configuration to identify repository candidates for a particular Spring Data module. Using multiple persistence technology-specific annotations on the same domain type is possible and enables reuse of domain types across multiple persistence technologies. However, Spring Data can then no longer determine a unique module with which to bind the repository.

The last way to distinguish repositories is by scoping repository base packages. Base packages define the starting points for scanning for repository interface definitions, which implies having repository definitions located in the appropriate packages. By default, annotation-driven configuration uses the package of the configuration class. The [base package in XML-based configuration](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/docs/current/reference/html/index.html#repositories.create-instances.spring) is mandatory.

The following example shows annotation-driven configuration of base packages:

**Annotation-driven configuration of base packages**

```
@EnableJpaRepositories(basePackages = "com.acme.repositories.jpa")
@EnableMongoRepositories(basePackages = "com.acme.repositories.mongo")
class Configuration { … }
```

### Defining Query Methods

The repository proxy has two ways to derive a store-specific query from the method name:

- By deriving the query from the method name directly.
- By using a manually defined query.

Available options depend on the actual store. However, there must be a strategy that decides what actual query is created. The next section describes the available options.

#### Query Lookup Strategies

The following strategies are available for the repository infrastructure to resolve the query. With XML configuration, you can configure the strategy at the namespace through the `query-lookup-strategy` attribute. For Java configuration, you can use the `queryLookupStrategy` attribute of the `Enable${store}Repositories` annotation. Some strategies may not be supported for particular datastores.

- `CREATE` attempts to construct a store-specific query from the query method name. The general approach is to remove a given set of well known prefixes from the method name and parse the rest of the method. You can read more about query construction in “[Query Creation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/docs/current/reference/html/index.html#repositories.query-methods.query-creation)”.
- `USE_DECLARED_QUERY` tries to find a declared query and throws an exception if it cannot find one. The query can be defined by an annotation somewhere or declared by other means. See the documentation of the specific store to find available options for that store. If the repository infrastructure does not find a declared query for the method at bootstrap time, it fails.
- `CREATE_IF_NOT_FOUND` (the default) combines `CREATE` and `USE_DECLARED_QUERY`. It looks up a declared query first, and, if no declared query is found, it creates a custom method name-based query. This is the default lookup strategy and, thus, is used if you do not configure anything explicitly. It allows quick query definition by method names but also custom-tuning of these queries by introducing declared queries as needed.

#### Query Creation

The query builder mechanism built into the Spring Data repository infrastructure is useful for building constraining queries over entities of the repository.

**Query creation from method names**

```
interface PersonRepository extends Repository<Person, Long> {

  List<Person> findByEmailAddressAndLastname(EmailAddress emailAddress, String lastname);

  // Enables the distinct flag for the query
  List<Person> findDistinctPeopleByLastnameOrFirstname(String lastname, String firstname);
  List<Person> findPeopleDistinctByLastnameOrFirstname(String lastname, String firstname);

  // Enabling ignoring case for an individual property
  List<Person> findByLastnameIgnoreCase(String lastname);
  // Enabling ignoring case for all suitable properties
  List<Person> findByLastnameAndFirstnameAllIgnoreCase(String lastname, String firstname);

  // Enabling static ORDER BY for a query
  List<Person> findByLastnameOrderByFirstnameAsc(String lastname);
  List<Person> findByLastnameOrderByFirstnameDesc(String lastname);
}
```

Parsing query method names is divided into subject and predicate. The first part (`find…By`, `exists…By`) defines the subject of the query, the second part forms the predicate. The introducing clause (subject) can contain further expressions. Any text between `find` (or other introducing keywords) and `By` is considered to be descriptive unless using one of the result-limiting keywords such as a `Distinct` to set a distinct flag on the query to be created or [`Top`/`First` to limit query results](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/docs/current/reference/html/index.html#repositories.limit-query-result).

The appendix contains the [full list of query method subject keywords](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/docs/current/reference/html/index.html#appendix.query.method.subject) and [query method predicate keywords including sorting and letter-casing modifiers](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/docs/current/reference/html/index.html#appendix.query.method.predicate). However, the first `By` acts as a delimiter to indicate the start of the actual criteria predicate. At a very basic level, you can define conditions on entity properties and concatenate them with `And` and `Or`.

The actual result of parsing the method depends on the persistence store for which you create the query. However, there are some general things to notice:

- The expressions are usually property traversals combined with operators that can be concatenated. You can combine property expressions with `AND` and `OR`. You also get support for operators such as `Between`, `LessThan`, `GreaterThan`, and `Like` for the property expressions. The supported operators can vary by datastore, so consult the appropriate part of your reference documentation.
- The method parser supports setting an `IgnoreCase` flag for individual properties (for example, `findByLastnameIgnoreCase(…)`) or for all properties of a type that supports ignoring case (usually `String` instances — for example, `findByLastnameAndFirstnameAllIgnoreCase(…)`). Whether ignoring cases is supported may vary by store, so consult the relevant sections in the reference documentation for the store-specific query method.
- You can apply static ordering by appending an `OrderBy` clause to the query method that references a property and by providing a sorting direction (`Asc` or `Desc`). To create a query method that supports dynamic sorting, see “[Special parameter handling](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/docs/current/reference/html/index.html#repositories.special-parameters)”.

#### Property Expressions

Property expressions can refer only to a direct property of the managed entity, as shown in the preceding example. At query creation time, you already make sure that the parsed property is a property of the managed domain class. However, you can also define constraints by traversing nested properties. Consider the following method signature:

```
List<Person> findByAddressZipCode(ZipCode zipCode);
```

Because we treat the underscore character as a reserved character, we strongly advise following standard Java naming conventions (that is, not using underscores in property names but using camel case instead).

#### Special parameter handling

To handle parameters in your query, define method parameters as already seen in the preceding examples. Besides that, the infrastructure recognizes certain specific types like `Pageable` and `Sort`, to apply pagination and sorting to your queries dynamically. The following example demonstrates these features:

**Using** `Pageable`**,** `Slice`**, and** `Sort` **in query methods**

```
Page<User> findByLastname(String lastname, Pageable pageable);

Slice<User> findByLastname(String lastname, Pageable pageable);

List<User> findByLastname(String lastname, Sort sort);

List<User> findByLastname(String lastname, Pageable pageable);
```

 APIs taking `Sort` and `Pageable` expect non-`null` values to be handed into methods. If you do not want to apply any sorting or pagination, use `Sort.unsorted()` and `Pageable.unpaged()`.

The first method lets you pass an `org.springframework.data.domain.Pageable` instance to the query method to dynamically add paging to your statically defined query. A `Page` knows about the total number of elements and pages available. It does so by the infrastructure triggering a count query to calculate the overall number. As this might be expensive (depending on the store used), you can instead return a `Slice`. A `Slice` knows only about whether a next `Slice` is available, which might be sufficient when walking through a larger result set.

Sorting options are handled through the `Pageable` instance, too. If you need only sorting, add an `org.springframework.data.domain.Sort` parameter to your method. As you can see, returning a `List` is also possible. In this case, the additional metadata required to build the actual `Page` instance is not created (which, in turn, means that the additional count query that would have been necessary is not issued). Rather, it restricts the query to look up only the given range of entities.

##### Paging and Sorting

You can define simple sorting expressions by using property names. You can concatenate expressions to collect multiple criteria into one expression.

**Defining sort expressions**

```
Sort sort = Sort.by("firstname").ascending()
  .and(Sort.by("lastname").descending());
```

**Defining sort expressions by using the type-safe API**

```
TypedSort<Person> person = Sort.sort(Person.class);

Sort sort = person.by(Person::getFirstname).ascending()
  .and(person.by(Person::getLastname).descending());
```

#### Limiting Query Results

You can limit the results of query methods by using the `first` or `top` keywords, which you can use interchangeably. You can append an optional numeric value to `top` or `first` to specify the maximum result size to be returned. If the number is left out, a result size of 1 is assumed. The following example shows how to limit the query size:

**Limiting the result size of a query with** `Top` **and** `First`

```
User findFirstByOrderByLastnameAsc();

User findTopByOrderByAgeDesc();

Page<User> queryFirst10ByLastname(String lastname, Pageable pageable);

Slice<User> findTop3ByLastname(String lastname, Pageable pageable);

List<User> findFirst10ByLastname(String lastname, Sort sort);

List<User> findTop10ByLastname(String lastname, Pageable pageable);
```

The limiting expressions also support the `Distinct` keyword for datastores that support distinct queries. Also, for the queries that limit the result set to one instance, wrapping the result into with the `Optional` keyword is supported.

If pagination or slicing is applied to a limiting query pagination (and the calculation of the number of available pages), it is applied within the limited result.

 Limiting the results in combination with dynamic sorting by using a `Sort` parameter lets you express query methods for the 'K' smallest as well as for the 'K' biggest elements.

#### Repository Methods Returning Collections or Iterables

Query methods that return multiple results can use standard Java `Iterable`, `List`, and `Set`. Beyond that, we support returning Spring Data’s `Streamable`, a custom extension of `Iterable`, as well as collection types provided by [Vavr](https://www.vavr.io/). Refer to the appendix explaining all possible [query method return types](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/docs/current/reference/html/index.html#appendix.query.return.types).

##### Using Streamable as Query Method Return Type

You can use `Streamable` as alternative to `Iterable` or any collection type. It provides convenience methods to access a non-parallel `Stream` (missing from `Iterable`) and the ability to directly `….filter(…)` and `….map(…)` over the elements and concatenate the `Streamable` to others:

**Using Streamable to combine query method results**

```
interface PersonRepository extends Repository<Person, Long> {
  Streamable<Person> findByFirstnameContaining(String firstname);
  Streamable<Person> findByLastnameContaining(String lastname);
}

Streamable<Person> result = repository.findByFirstnameContaining("av")
  .and(repository.findByLastnameContaining("ea"));
```

##### Returning Custom Streamable Wrapper Types

Providing dedicated wrapper types for collections is a commonly used pattern to provide an API for a query result that returns multiple elements. Usually, these types are used by invoking a repository method returning a collection-like type and creating an instance of the wrapper type manually. You can avoid that additional step as Spring Data lets you use these wrapper types as query method return types if they meet the following criteria:

1. The type implements `Streamable`.
2. The type exposes either a constructor or a static factory method named `of(…)` or `valueOf(…)` that takes `Streamable` as an argument.

The following listing shows an example:

```java
class Product {                                         
  MonetaryAmount getPrice() { … }
  //A Product entity that exposes API to access the product’s price.
}

@RequiredArgConstructor(staticName = "of")
class Products implements Streamable<Product> { 
    //A wrapper type for a Streamable<Product> that can be constructed by using Products.of(…) (factory method created with the Lombok annotation).
//A standard constructor taking the Streamable<Product> will do as well.

  private Streamable<Product> streamable;

  public MonetaryAmount getTotal() {    
      //	The wrapper type exposes an additional API, calculating new values on the Streamable<Product>.
    return streamable.stream()
      .map(Priced::getPrice)
      .reduce(Money.of(0), MonetaryAmount::add);
  }


  @Override
  public Iterator<Product> iterator() {   
      //	Implement the Streamable interface and delegate to the actual result.
    return streamable.iterator();
  }
}

interface ProductRepository implements Repository<Product, Long> {
  Products findAllByDescriptionContaining(String text); 
    //That wrapper type Products can be used directly as a query method return type.
}
//You do not need to return Streamable<Product> and manually wrap it after the query in the repository client.
```

#### Streaming Query Results

 **Stream the result of a query with Java 8** `Stream<T>`

```
@Query("select u from User u")
Stream<User> findAllByCustomQueryAndStream();

Stream<User> readAllByFirstnameNotNull();

@Query("select u from User u")
Stream<User> streamAllPaged(Pageable pageable);
```

**Working with a** `Stream<T>` **result in a** `try-with-resources` **block**

```
try (Stream<User> stream = repository.findAllByCustomQueryAndStream()) {
  stream.forEach(…);
}
```

#### Asynchronous Query Results

You can run repository queries asynchronously by using [Spring’s asynchronous method running capability](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.3.5/spring-framework-reference/integration.html#scheduling). This means the method returns immediately upon invocation while the actual query occurs in a task that has been submitted to a Spring `TaskExecutor`. Asynchronous queries differ from reactive queries and should not be mixed. 

```
@Async
Future<User> findByFirstname(String firstname);               
//	Use java.util.concurrent.Future as the return type.
@Async
CompletableFuture<User> findOneByFirstname(String firstname); 
//Use a Java 8 java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture as the return type.
@Async
ListenableFuture<User> findOneByLastname(String lastname);   
//Use a org.springframework.util.concurrent.ListenableFuture as the return type.
```

### Creating Repository Instances

You can also trigger the repository infrastructure by using a store-specific `@Enable${store}Repositories` annotation on a Java configuration class. For an introduction to Java-based configuration of the Spring container, see [JavaConfig in the Spring reference documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.3.5/spring-framework-reference/core.html#beans-java).

A sample configuration to enable Spring Data repositories resembles the following:

**Sample annotation-based repository configuration**

```
@Configuration
@EnableJpaRepositories("com.acme.repositories")
class ApplicationConfiguration {

  @Bean
  EntityManagerFactory entityManagerFactory() {
    // …
  }
}
```

#### Standalone Usage

You can also use the repository infrastructure outside of a Spring container — for example, in CDI environments. You still need some Spring libraries in your classpath, but, generally, you can set up repositories programmatically as well. The Spring Data modules that provide repository support ship with a persistence technology-specific `RepositoryFactory` that you can use, as follows:

**Standalone usage of the repository factory**

```
RepositoryFactorySupport factory = … // Instantiate factory here
UserRepository repository = factory.getRepository(UserRepository.class);
```

### Custom Implementations for Spring Data Repositories

When a query method requires a different behavior or cannot be implemented by query derivation, you need to provide a custom implementation. Spring Data repositories let you provide custom repository code and integrate it with generic CRUD abstraction and query method functionality.

####  Customizing Individual Repositories

To enrich a repository with custom functionality, you must first define a fragment interface and an implementation for the custom functionality, as follows:

**Interface for custom repository functionality**

```
interface CustomizedUserRepository {
  void someCustomMethod(User user);
}
```

**Implementation of custom repository functionality**

The most important part of the class name that corresponds to the fragment interface is the `Impl` postfix.

```
class CustomizedUserRepositoryImpl implements CustomizedUserRepository {

  public void someCustomMethod(User user) {
    // Your custom implementation
  }
}
```

The implementation itself does not depend on Spring Data and can be a regular Spring bean. Consequently, you can use standard dependency injection behavior to inject references to other beans (such as a `JdbcTemplate`), take part in aspects, and so on.

**Changes to your repository interface**

```
interface UserRepository extends CrudRepository<User, Long>, CustomizedUserRepository {

  // Declare query methods here
}
```

Extending the fragment interface with your repository interface combines the CRUD and custom functionality and makes it available to clients.

Spring Data repositories are implemented by using fragments that form a repository composition. Fragments are the base repository, functional aspects (such as [QueryDsl](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/docs/current/reference/html/index.html#core.extensions.querydsl)), and custom interfaces along with their implementations. Each time you add an interface to your repository interface, you enhance the composition by adding a fragment. The base repository and repository aspect implementations are provided by each Spring Data module.

**Fragments with their implementations**

```
interface HumanRepository {
  void someHumanMethod(User user);
}

class HumanRepositoryImpl implements HumanRepository {

  public void someHumanMethod(User user) {
    // Your custom implementation
  }
}

interface ContactRepository {

  void someContactMethod(User user);

  User anotherContactMethod(User user);
}

class ContactRepositoryImpl implements ContactRepository {

  public void someContactMethod(User user) {
    // Your custom implementation
  }

  public User anotherContactMethod(User user) {
    // Your custom implementation
  }
}
```

The following example shows the interface for a custom repository that extends `CrudRepository`:

**Changes to your repository interface**

```
interface UserRepository extends CrudRepository<User, Long>, HumanRepository, ContactRepository {

  // Declare query methods here
}
```

Repositories may be composed of multiple custom implementations that are imported in the order of their declaration. Custom implementations have a higher priority than the base implementation and repository aspects. This ordering lets you override base repository and aspect methods and resolves ambiguity if two fragments contribute the same method signature. Repository fragments are not limited to use in a single repository interface. Multiple repositories may use a fragment interface, letting you reuse customizations across different repositories.

The following example shows a repository fragment and its implementation:

**Fragments overriding** `save(…)`

```
interface CustomizedSave<T> {
  <S extends T> S save(S entity);
}

class CustomizedSaveImpl<T> implements CustomizedSave<T> {

  public <S extends T> S save(S entity) {
    // Your custom implementation
  }
}
```

**Customized repository interfaces**

```
interface UserRepository extends CrudRepository<User, Long>, CustomizedSave<User> {
}

interface PersonRepository extends CrudRepository<Person, Long>, CustomizedSave<Person> {
}
```

##### Configuration

If you use namespace configuration, the repository infrastructure tries to autodetect custom implementation fragments by scanning for classes below the package in which it found a repository. These classes need to follow the naming convention of appending the namespace element’s `repository-impl-postfix` attribute to the fragment interface name. This postfix defaults to `Impl`. The following example shows a repository that uses the default postfix and a repository that sets a custom value for the postfix:

**Configuration example**

```
<repositories base-package="com.acme.repository" />

<repositories base-package="com.acme.repository" repository-impl-postfix="MyPostfix" />
```

The first configuration in the preceding example tries to look up a class called `com.acme.repository.CustomizedUserRepositoryImpl` to act as a custom repository implementation. The second example tries to look up `com.acme.repository.CustomizedUserRepositoryMyPostfix`.

###### Resolution of Ambiguity

If multiple implementations with matching class names are found in different packages, Spring Data uses the bean names to identify which one to use.

Given the following two custom implementations for the `CustomizedUserRepository` shown earlier, the first implementation is used. Its bean name is `customizedUserRepositoryImpl`, which matches that of the fragment interface (`CustomizedUserRepository`) plus the postfix `Impl`.

**Resolution of ambiguous implementations**

```
package com.acme.impl.one;

class CustomizedUserRepositoryImpl implements CustomizedUserRepository {

  // Your custom implementation
}
```

```
package com.acme.impl.two;

@Component("specialCustomImpl")
class CustomizedUserRepositoryImpl implements CustomizedUserRepository {

  // Your custom implementation
}
```

If you annotate the `UserRepository` interface with `@Component("specialCustom")`, the bean name plus `Impl` then matches the one defined for the repository implementation in `com.acme.impl.two`, and it is used instead of the first one.

#### Customize the Base Repository

The approach described in the [preceding section](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/docs/current/reference/html/index.html#repositories.manual-wiring) requires customization of each repository interfaces when you want to customize the base repository behavior so that all repositories are affected. To instead change behavior for all repositories, you can create an implementation that extends the persistence technology-specific repository base class. This class then acts as a custom base class for the repository proxies, as shown in the following example:

**Custom repository base class**

```
class MyRepositoryImpl<T, ID>

  private final EntityManager entityManager;

  MyRepositoryImpl(JpaEntityInformation entityInformation,
                          EntityManager entityManager) {
    super(entityInformation, entityManager);

    // Keep the EntityManager around to used from the newly introduced methods.
    this.entityManager = entityManager;

####  Web support

Spring Data modules that support the repository programming model ship with a variety of web support. The web related components require Spring MVC JARs to be on the classpath. Some of them even provide integration with [Spring HATEOAS](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-hateoas). In general, the integration support is enabled by using the `@EnableSpringDataWebSupport` annotation in your JavaConfig configuration class, as the following example shows:

Example 45. Enabling Spring Data web support

```
@Configuration
@EnableWebMvc
@EnableSpringDataWebSupport
class WebConfiguration {}
```

The `@EnableSpringDataWebSupport` annotation registers a few components. We discuss those later in this section. It also detects Spring HATEOAS on the classpath and registers integration components (if present) for it as well.
